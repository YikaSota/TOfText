## [ezkerbkun] Indecipherable Indigestion

Hphm. I've been nothing but nice to the village and this is what I get in return? A brat trying to steal my possessions?

哼？人们都说“善有善报，恶有恶报”。那我保护这个村子算是做了恶事咯？都有人偷东西都偷到我家里来了？

Oh well, I suppose it's not the whole villages fault for a poorly taught thief. Perhaps some time on my hips will serve you a lesson...

看在你还是个没什么见识的小孩的份上…算啦，就罚你变成我的身体上的软肉吧~ 要记住下辈子别在偷东西咯

I'm sorry…

呜呜呜… 真的很对不起…

Well, I suppose it's over. It's been nice being able to relax, but I should really go visit Marisa to ask her about 'returning' some of my spell-books...

嗝呜——真舒服呀~ 嗯... 趁着还没消化完，去拜访一下魔理沙吧，如果她还不还书…就把她也关进肚子里！哼！不还书就会变成大姐姐的食物！
